```{r niruncer,results='hide',warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
tabs("niruncert",paste0("Sector Agriculture: EU-28 uncertainty estimates"))


```

`r tabs("niruncert",display="cite")` shows the total EU-28 uncertainty estimates for the sector Agriculture and the uncertainty estimates for the relevant gases of each source category. The highest level uncertainty was estimated for N2O from 3D and the lowest for CH4 from sector 3A. With regard to the uncertainty on trend N2O from sector 3J shows the highest uncertainty estimates, CH4 from sector 3A the lowest. For a description of the Tier 1 uncertainty analysis carried out for the EU-28 see Chapter 1.6.

Note: Emissions are in Gg CO2 equivalents; trend uncertainty is presented as percentage points; the sum of the source category emissions may not be the total sector emissions of the EU-NIR because uncertainty estimates are not available for all source categories in each of this 28 EU countries
