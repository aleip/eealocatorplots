# Agriculture (CRF Sector 3)

Half the European Union's land is farmed. This fact alone highlights the importance of farming for the EU's natural environment. Farming and nature exercise a profound influence over each other. Farming has contributed over the centuries to creating and maintaining a variety of valuable semi-natural habitats. Today these shape the majority of the EU's landscapes and are home to many of the EU's richest wildlife. Farming also supports a diverse rural community that is not only a fundamental asset of European culture, but also plays an essential role in maintaining the environment in a healthy state[^dgagri].

The links between the richness of the natural environment and farming practices are complex. While many valuable habitats in Europe are maintained by extensive farming, and a wide range of wild species rely on this for their survival, agricultural practices can also have an adverse impact on natural resources. Pollution of soil, water and air, fragmentation of habitats and loss of wildlife can be the result of inappropriate agricultural practices and land use.

Agriculture in Europe is determined by the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) of the European Union. The CAP dates from 1957, and its foundations are entrenched in the Treaty of Rome. Initially, the emphasis of the CAP was to increase agricultural productivity, partly for food security reasons, but also to ensure that the EU had a viable agricultural sector and that consumers had a stable supply of affordable food (Gay et al., 2005). With the MacSharry reform of 1992 several steps were taken by the EU to shift CAP subsidies away from price and market support towards direct support for farmers. This was further pursued with the Agenda 2000 reform, as signified by the shift in focus towards the maintenance and enhancement of the rural environment and the growing recognition of agriculture as a multifunctional activity. In environmental terms, the focus is on less-favoured areas and areas with environmental restrictions, and 
on agricultural production methods designed to protect the environment and to maintain the countryside. 

However price support and income payments, together with milk quotas, remained the dominant support measures. The 2003 CAP reform made further progress in the direction initiated by the Agenda 2000 reform, by aiming to make European agriculture more market oriented and giving a stronger focus to environmental protection. With the CAP reform, cross-compliance became an obligatory element of the CAP. Cross-compliance establishes a link between the granting of income support to the farmers and the compliance by the beneficiary with specified requirements of public interest (Oenema, 2008). These are given in:

* "Statutory management requirements" (SMR, Annex III of Regulation (EC) No 1782/2003) which are set in 19 community legislative acts on environment, food safety, animal health and welfare, as well as
* The obligation to maintaining land in good agricultural and environmental conditions (GAECs) and maintaining permanent pasture at level at 1.5.2004. Definitions of GAEC are specified at national or regional level and should warrant appropriate soil protection, ensure a minimum level of maintenance of soil organic matter and soil structure and avoid the deterioration of habitats.

In 2013, the Council of the EU Agriculture Ministers adopted four Basic Regulations for a reformed CAP following a CAP Health Check[^healthcheck] in 2008 and a Commission Communication on the CAP towards 2020[^captowards2020] in 2011. The four legislative texts that regulate the post-2013 CAP are:

* Rural Development: Regulation 1305/2013[^1305-2013]
* "Horizontal" issues such as funding and controls: Regulation 1306/2013[^1306-2013]
* Direct payments for farmers: Regulation 1307/2013[^1307-2013]
* Market measures: Regulation 1308/2013[^1308-2013]

The Nitrates Directive (Council Directive 91/676/EEC) is the SMR with the largest impact on greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture. The directive aims at reducing and preventing water pollution caused by nitrates from agricultural sources with the goal that nitrate concentrations in groundwater will not exceed 50 mg NO~3~^-^ l^-1^ and listing codes of good practice (Annex II A) to be implemented by the farmers on a voluntary basis. Nitrate vulnerable zones must be designated on the basis of monitoring results which indicate that the groundwater and surface waters in these zones are or could be affected by nitrate pollution from agriculture. The action program must contain mandatory measures relating to: (i) periods when application of animal manure and fertilizers is prohibited; (ii) capacity of and facilities for storage of animal manure; and (iii) limits to the amounts of animal manure and fertilizers applied to land.

This has affected emissions in most countries, for example in Belgium, Manure Action Plans (based on the Nitrate directive) in Flanders affected NH3 volatilization from manure application. The first action plan in 1991 regulated the reduced in which manure can be spread and foresees low-emission techniques for the application of manure on land. The MAP2bis in 2000 focuses on the reduction of the manure surplus and manure processing in order to reduce the NH3 emissions from manure application on land. Other MAP's followed.

In Denmark, the environmental policy has introduced a series of measures to prevent loss of nitrogen from agricultural soils to the aquatic environment. The measures include improvements to the utilisation of nitrogen in manure, a ban on manure application during autumn and winter, increasing area with winter-green fields to catch nitrogen, a maximum number of animals per hectare and maximum nitrogen application rates for agricultural crops. All farmers are obliged to do N-mineral accounting at farm and field level with the N-excretion data from FAS (Faculty of Agricultural Sciences). The N figures also include the quantities of mineral fertilizers bought and sold. Suppliers of mineral fertilizers are required to report all N sales to commercial farmers to the Plant Directorate. An active environmental policy has brought about a decrease in the N-excretion and a decrease of emission per produced animal, because of more efficient feeding. As a result of increasing requirements to reduce the nitrogen loss to the environment, the consumption of nitrogen in synthetic fertilizer has more than halved since 1990.

In the Netherlands, manure and fertilizer policy influences livestock numbers. Especially young cattle, pigs and poultry numbers decreased by the introduction of measures like buying up part of the so-called pig and poultry production rights (ceilings for total animal numbers) by the government and lowering the maximum nutrient application standards for manure and fertilizer.
However, greater compliance to standards and requirements for animal welfare and the housing of animals may contribute to increasing emissions (so-called pollution swapping).

Beside the environmentally-targeted directives, also the so-called first pillar of the CAP (dealing with market support in contrast to pillar two covering rural development measures) had a strong impact on the greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture in Europe, namely through the milk quota system, which lead to a strong reduction of animal numbers in the dairy sector to compensate for the increasing animal performance during the last decades.

Other important policies affecting greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture, particularly by addressing the abatement of air pollution through the control of NOx and NH3 emissions include, under others,

* the 1999 Gothenburg Protocol under the Convention on Long Range Transboundary Air Pollution (CLRTAP[^clrtap]) to 'Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground-level Ozone', which entered into force on 22 June 2006; 
* the National Emission Ceilings Directive (NEC - Directive 2001/81/EC[^nec]), which sets upper limits for each Member State for the total emissions in 2010 of the four pollutants responsible for acidification, eutrophication and ground-level ozone pollution;
* the Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive (Directive 2008/1/EC[^ippc]), which was established in 1996, and aims at minimizing pollution from point sources, i. e., intensive animal production facilities (pig and poultry farms, with > 2000 fattening pigs; more than750 sows or more than 40,000 head of poultry). These are required under the directive to apply control techniques for preventing NH3 emissions according to Best Available Technology (BAT).

Structural changes are caused also by the general development of countries. For example, in Finland, the membership in the EU resulted in changes in the economic structure followed by an increase in the average farm size and a decrease in the number of small farms (Pipatti, 2001), causing also a decrease in the livestock numbers for most animal types. Swedish agriculture has undergone radical structural changes and rationalizations over the past 50 years. One fifth of the Swedish arable land cultivated in the 1950s is no longer farmed. Closures have mainly affected small holdings and those remaining are growing larger. In 1999, some 31,000 agricultural holdings were livestock farms, 14,000 were purely crop husbandry farms, and only 5,000 were a combination of the two. Livestock farmers predominately engage in milk production and the main crops grown in Sweden are grain and fodder crops. The decrease of agricultural land area has continued since Sweden joined the European Union in 1995 and the acreages of land for hay and silage has increased. Organic farming increased from 3% of the arable land area in 1995 to 17% in 2007.

```

In the year `r lastyear`, `r curgas[c(1,3)]` and `r curgas[2]` emissions from CRF sector `r cursec` `r curseclong` were `r percent(eusharech4,1)`, `r percent(eusharen2o,1)`, and `r percent(eushareco2,1)` of total `r eukp` CH4, N2O, and CO2 emissions, respectively. Total emissions from agriculture were `r absval(sum(curemissions[eusel,lastyear]),0)` with contributions from CH4, N2O, and CO2 of `r absval(curemissions[eusel & curemissions$gas=="CH4",lastyear],0)`, `r absval(curemissions[eusel & curemissions$gas=="N2O",lastyear],0)` and `r absval(curemissions[eusel & curemissions$gas=="CO2",lastyear],0)`, respectively.<br>

Thus, CH4, N2O, and CO2  contributed with `r percent(eusharech4)`,  `r percent(eusharen2o)` and `r percent(eushareco2)` total `r eukp` GHG emissions. They make `r percent(eushareagrich4ghg,1)`, `r percent(eushareagrin2oghg,1)` and `r percent(eushareagrico2ghg,1)` of total agricultural emissions.

`r figs("figtrendem",display="cite")` shows the development of total GHG emissions from agriculture from `r firstyear` to `r lastyear` and the `r trendstrength(sum(curemissions[eusel,lastyear])/sum(curemissions[eusel,firstyear]))` `r deorincrease(1-sum(curemissions[eusel,lastyear])/sum(curemissions[eusel,firstyear]))` in `r eukp`. The decrease was most pronounced for `r curgas[which(curtrend==min(curtrend))]` with a decrease of `r percent(1-curtrend[which(curtrend==min(curtrend))],1)`, followed by `r curgas[rank(curtrend,1)[2]]` with a decrease of `r percent(1-curtrend[rank(curtrend,1)[2]],1)` and `r curgas[rank(curtrend,1)[3]]` with a decrease of `r percent(1-curtrend[rank(curtrend,1)[3]],1)`

`r figs("figshares",display="cite")` shows that largest reductions occurred in the largest key sources CH4 from *3.A.1: Cattle* and N2O from *3.D.1: Direct emissions from managed soils*. The main reasons for this are decreasing use of fertiliser and manure and declining cattle numbers in most Member States.

## Source categories and methodological issues

In this section we present the information relevant for `r eukp` key source categories in the sector 3 Agriculture.

Sources categories considered are: 

* CH4 emissions from source category 3.A.1 - Cattle 
* CH4 emissions from source category 3.A.2 - Sheep 
* CH4 emissions from source category 3.B.1.1 - Cattle
* CH4 emissions from source category 3.B.1.3 - Swine
* N2O emissions from source category 3.B.1.1 - Cattle
* N2O emissions from source category 3.B.1.5 - Indirect emissions
* N2O emissions from source category 3.B.1.4 - Other Livestock (mainly Poultry)
* N2O emissions from source category 3.D.1.1 - Direct N2O emissions from managed soils from inorganic N fertilizers
* N2O emissions from source category 3.D.1.2 - Direct N2O emissions from managed soils from organic N fertilizers
* N2O emissions from source category 3.D.2.1 - Indirect Emissions from Managed Soils, Atmospheric Deposition
* N2O emissions from source category 3.D.2.2 - Indirect Emissions from Managed Soils, Nitrogen leaching and run-off

Other source categories are not contributing to a key source analysis at `r eukp` level and are therefore not further discussed here.

For each of the above-mentioned source categories, data on the countries contributing most to `r eukp` emissions and to `r eukp` emissions trend are provided, as well as information on relevant activity data and IEFs and other parameters, if relevant.


Many countries recognize that in the agriculture sector the emissions from the different categories are inherently linked and are best estimated in a comprehensive model that covers not only greenhouse gases (CH4 and N2O) in a consistent manner, but also ammonia. Estimations of ammonia emissions are required for reporting under the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and are needed to estimate indirect N2O emissions. Hence, some countries have developed comprehensive models covering consistently different source categories and different gases.  

* Austria: For the calculation of the losses of gaseous N species the mass-flow procedure pursuant to EMEP/CORINAIR is used. A detailed emission model for NH3, NMVOC and NOx has been integrated into the national inventory.
* Germany: Germany uses the emission inventory model GAS-EM to calculate consistently emissions of CH4, NH3, N2O, and NO from agricultural sources. It is based on IPCC methodologies and has been developed in recent years with a comprehensive description found in Roesemann et al. (2013). Basis of the model is the feed intake which determine emissions in category 3.A and which determines N and C excretion rates relevant for category 3.B and also 3.D. Data are available at district (Landkreis, livestock characterisation, housing systems, manure management systems) and regional (Bundesland) level. N-emissions are considered within an N-flow concept (Daemmgen and Hutchings, 2005). In the N-flow concept, only remaining N in manure is transferred to storage systems, after subtraction of emissions in housing systems. Emissions are subtracted from the total N-pool.
* Denmark: The emissions from the agricultural sector are calculated in a comprehensive agricultural model complex called IDA (Integrated Database model for Agricultural emissions). The model complex is designed in a relational data-base system (MS Access). Input data are stored in tables in one database called IDA_Backend and the calculations are carried out as queries in another linked database called IDA. This model complex is implemented in great detail and is used to cover emissions of NH3, particulate matter and greenhouse gases. Thus, there is a direct coherence between the NH3 emission and the emission of N2O. 
Finland: Finland uses a nitrogen mass flow model (except for N-fixing, crop residue and sewage sludge) accounts for nitrogen losses as ammonia and nitrous oxide emissions during manure management in animal houses, during storage and application; the calculation method was developed in order to avoid double-counting.
