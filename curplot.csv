# EU-GIRP (EU-Greenhouse gas Inventory Reporting Plots; eealocatorplots)
# File curplot.csv
# File required for the EU-GIRP R script eealocatorplots.r
# Purpose: steers the R script defining which plots need to be generated
#          see below for information how to use this file!!

# Content of file: 
#   - definition of plot-requests for EU-GIRP
#
#Note: give here a list of the categories which should be included in the plotting				
#AD: if the AD data should be plotted 			
#EM: if the EM data should be plotted (according to below)				
#IEF if the IEF data should be plotted (according to below)	
#any other parameter as it is given in the meta_data_dimensions.csv
#for each 'measure' that should be plotted first give the measure-acronym (e.g. EMCH4) and
#          then a value [0-7] that defines which plots should be done according to below.
#Example: 4ACATT,AD,3,EMCH4,7,IEF,0 for
#         Cat 4A (enteric fermenation) for cattle, plot of AD (livestock numbers)
#         and emissions (EMCH4) both value and trend plot (1+2=3) but no IEF plot (0)
#         and not other parameter plot (not given)
# Note that each row must start with the category, source,gas (4A,CATT,CH4) followed by 
#      AD and the desired plot-wish-number, the emissions and desired plotwishnumber. 
#      All other item-pairs (measure,plotwishnumber) are not obligatory and do not need to follow any order.
# Values: 				
# 0: plot not needed				
# 1: Include VALUE plot				
# 2: Include TREND plot				
# 4: Include COUNTRY plot				
# 3 5 6 7: several plots according to the sum of the above
