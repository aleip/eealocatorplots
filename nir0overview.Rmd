In the year `r lastyear`, `r curgas[c(2,1)]` and `r curgas[3]` emissions from CRF sector `r cursec` `r curseclong` were `r percent(eusharech4,1)`, `r percent(eusharen2o,1)`, and `r percent(eushareco2,1)` of total `r curgas[c(2,1)]` and `r curgas[3]` `r eukp` emissions, respectively. Total emissions from agriculture were `r absval(sum(curemissions[eusel,lastyear]),0)` with contributions from CH4, N2O, and CO2 of `r absval(curemissions[eusel & curemissions$gas=="CH4",lastyear],0)`, `r absval(curemissions[eusel & curemissions$gas=="N2O",lastyear],0)` and `r absval(curemissions[eusel & curemissions$gas=="CO2",lastyear],0)`, respectively. Thus, CH4, N2O, and CO2  contributed with `r percent(eusharech4total,d=1)`,  `r percent(eusharen2ototal,d=1)` and `r percent(eushareco2total,d=1)` to total `r eukp` GHG emissions. They make `r percent(eushareagrich4ghg,1)`, `r percent(eushareagrin2oghg,1)` and `r percent(eushareagrico2ghg,1)` of total agricultural emissions.

`r figs("figtrendem",display="cite")` shows the development of total GHG emissions from agriculture from `r round(euagritotalghg[firstyear]/1000,0)` Mt CO2-eq in `r firstyear` to `r round(euagritotalghg[lastyear]/1000,0)` Mt CO2-eq in `r lastyear` and the `r trendstrength(sum(curemissions[eusel,lastyear])/sum(curemissions[eusel,firstyear]))` `r deorincrease(1-sum(curemissions[eusel,lastyear])/sum(curemissions[eusel,firstyear]))` in `r eukp`. The reduction of emissions was most pronounced for `r curgas[which(curtrend==min(curtrend))]` with a decrease of `r percent(1-curtrend[which(curtrend==min(curtrend))],1)`, followed by `r curgas[rank(curtrend,1)[2]]` with a decrease of `r percent(1-curtrend[rank(curtrend,1)[2]],1)` and `r curgas[rank(curtrend,1)[3]]` with a decrease of `r percent(1-curtrend[rank(curtrend,1)[3]],1)`. The cut was most pronounced in the first decade with a total reduction of `r percent(1-euagritotalghg["2000"]/euagritotalghg[firstyear],d=1)` between 1990 and 2000, a further decrease by between 2000 and 2005, while remaining constant since 2005 (change `r percent(euagritotalghg[lastyear]/euagritotalghg["2005"]-1,d=1)`).

`r figs("figshares",display="cite")` shows that largest reductions occurred in the largest key sources CH4 from *3.A.1: Cattle* and N2O from *3.D.1: Direct emissions from managed soils*. The main reasons for this are decreasing use of fertiliser and manure and declining cattle numbers in most Member States. `r figs("figsharesb",display="cite")` shows the distribution of agricultural GHG emissions among the different source categories for the year `r lastyear`.

## Source categories and methodological issues

In this section, we present the information relevant for `r eukp` key source categories in the sector 3 Agriculture.

Key source categories identified are: 

* CH4 emissions from source category 3.A.1 - Dairy cattle.
* CH4 emissions from source category 3.A.1 - Non-dairy cattle. 
* CH4 emissions from source category 3.B.1.1 - Cattle
* CH4 emissions from source category 3.A.2 - Sheep.
* CH4 emissions from source category 3.A.4 - Other livestock.
* CH4 emissions from source category 3.B.1 - Manure management.
* N2O emissions from source category 3.B.2 - Manure management.
* N2O emissions from source category 3.D.1 - Direct N2O emissions from managed soils.
* N2O emissions from source category 3.D.2 - Indirect emissions from managed soils

<!--
Note: during agrichecks the function keycateuc calculates Level Key source categories based on the list of source categories obtained in 2017 from UBA-V. the agri-list has been changed acc to own preferences and consistent with the source categories in the NIR chapter. all emissions are ranked and cumulative emissions are calculated - based on this the L key source categories for EUC are identified for first and last year.

files saved at ecir/keycategories:
- keyeuagri.csv
- agridetem.csv (a mix of source categories to be used with emissions)
- agrimethods.csv

Further processing has been done in excel as in \\MARSBL1BHL\Agrienv\ghginventory\ecir\keycategories\keyeuagri~20170523.xlsx

- assign 'higher Tier or not' by country (1/0) in new column in sheet agrimethods
- transfer this info into sheet agridetem
- calculate share of higher-Tier emissions for EUC (e.g. =SUMPRODUCT(I934:I962,P934:P962)/SUM(P934:P962))
- transfer this info into sheet keyeuagri
- filter source categories and copy table into sheet 'Table 1'

Other source categories are not identified as key source in the analysis at `r eukp` level and are therefore not further discussed here. Emissions from source category J - other agriculture emissions are reported only from Germany (digestion of energy crops) and the UK (emissions from liming in oversee territories and crown dependencies).

For each of the above-mentioned source categories, data on the countries contributing most to `r eukp` emissions and to `r eukp` emissions trend are provided, as well as information on relevant activity data and IEFs and other parameters, if relevant.


Many countries recognize that in the agriculture sector the emissions from the different categories are inherently linked and are best estimated in a comprehensive model that covers not only greenhouse gases (CH4 and N2O) in a consistent manner, but also ammonia. Estimations of ammonia emissions are required for reporting under the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and are needed to estimate indirect N2O emissions. Hence, several countries have developed comprehensive models covering consistently different source categories and different gases.

Comment: recommendation to not focus on individual countries as more countries have such systems and they all should be mentioned (or none)

* Austria: For the calculation of the losses of gaseous N species the mass-flow procedure pursuant to EMEP/CORINAIR is used. A detailed emission model for NH3, NMVOC and NOx has been integrated into the national inventory.
* Germany: Germany uses the emission inventory model GAS-EM to calculate consistently emissions of CH4, NH3, N2O, and NO from agricultural sources. It is based on IPCC methodologies and has been developed in recent years with a comprehensive description found in Roesemann et al. (2013). Basis of the model is the feed intake which determine emissions in category 3.A and which determines N and C excretion rates relevant for category 3.B and also 3.D. Data are available at district (Landkreis, livestock characterisation, housing systems, manure management systems) and regional (Bundesland) level. N-emissions are considered within an N-flow concept (Daemmgen and Hutchings, 2005). In the N-flow concept, only remaining N in manure is transferred to storage systems, after subtraction of emissions in housing systems. Emissions are subtracted from the total N-pool.
* Denmark: The emissions from the agricultural sector are calculated in a comprehensive agricultural model complex called IDA (Integrated Database model for Agricultural emissions). The model complex is designed in a relational data-base system (MS Access). Input data are stored in tables in one database called IDA_Backend and the calculations are carried out as queries in another linked database called IDA. This model complex is implemented in great detail and is used to cover emissions of NH3, particulate matter and greenhouse gases. Thus, there is a direct coherence between the NH3 emission and the emission of N2O. 
Finland: Finland uses a nitrogen mass flow model (except for N-fixing, crop residue and sewage sludge) accounts for nitrogen losses as ammonia and nitrous oxide emissions during manure management in animal houses, during storage and application; the calculation method was developed in order to avoid double-counting.
* Finland: Direct N2O emissions and deposition from manure management are calculated with a national calculation model (Grönroos et al. 2009); leaching is calculated separately. The model integrates both ammonia and nitrous oxide emissions from manure in each phase of the manure management chain and allows accounting for the effect of possible abatement measures to volatilisation. The amount of N volatilised as NH3-N and NO-N from MMS is calculated in the model separately from the application to fields (NH3-N during and after spreading).
* The Netherlands: N-flows from animal production are assessed by the National Emission Model for Ammonia (NEMA). Results include emissions of ammonia (NH3), nitric oxide (NO), nitrous oxide (N2O) and nitrogen gas (N2) from stable and storage.
* Slovenia: a mass balance approach which tracks nitrogen throughout the system is used to estimate N2O emissions, based on EMEP/CORINAIR (2013) methodology. The amount of N which is lost through volatilisation is estimated simultaneously with direct N2O emissions using EMEP/CORINAIR (2013) methodology. Similar mass-flow approach, based on EMEP/EEA guidelines is followed by Iceland.
