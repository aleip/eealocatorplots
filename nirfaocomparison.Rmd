The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has developed a database of greenhouse gas emissions, contained in FAOSTAT, which provides estimations of the emissions of main gases in the agricultural sector (CH4 and N2O) and statistics on the activity data related to these emissions that generally cover the period 1990-`r faolast`. The data base can be consulted at the following link:

http://faostat3.fao.org/faostat-gateway/go/to/download/G1/*/E 

Emissions are specified for the different agricultural sub-domains, estimated by FAO following Tier 1 approach from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National GHG Inventories (IPCC, 2006), using activity data provided by countries and default emission factors by IPCC. The data provided by FAO does not necessarily match the numbers reported by countries to the UNFCCC in their national inventory reports.


```{r nirfaotabexp,results='hide',warning=FALSE,message=FALSE,echo=FALSE}
# EU values for FAO are calculated as average of country-sums.
# As some countries do not report for early years ()
tabs("nirfaotab",paste0("GHG emissions from the agricultural sector by emission source category, in kt CO2-eq/year and % of total emissions, for the whole EU-28+ISL, averaged over the years ",comprange,", for which reported data from all countries are available in both the FAOSTAT and the UNFCCC data bases are available."))
# see http://rapporter.github.io/pander/
```

The FAOSTAT database is intended primarily as a service to help member countries assess and report their emissions, as well as a useful international benchmark.  FAOSTAT emissions data are disseminated publicly to facilitate continuous feedback from member countries. The following table presents total GHG emissions of the agricultural sector by emission source category for the whole EU-28+Iceland and year `r faolast` (last year available in FAOSTAT). It compares emission values and the share of emissions by category in FAOSTAT database vs. UNFCCC values reported by countries in their National Inventory Reports (NIR).

`r tabs("nirfaotab",display='full')`
`r pander(curtable,emphasize.strong.cols=1:2,emphasize.verbatim.rows=2:4,round=c(0,0,0,1,0,1),digits=c(0,0,3,5,3,5))`&nbsp;

Comparing both databases, we can see that UNFCCC reports slightly higher total emissions than FAOSTAT (`r round(sum(curtable[1:(nrow(curtable)-1),3])/1000,1)` versus `r round(sum(curtable[1:(nrow(curtable)-1),5])/1000,1)`) Mt CO2-eq yr-1, even if categories 3.D.1.5, 3.G, 3.H and 3.I are not estimated in FAOSTAT (`r round(sum(curdiffs[,3])/1000,1)` versus `r round(sum(curdiffs[,4])/1000,1)`) Mt CO2-eq yr-1. Looking at the individual emission categories, we can also identify differences between the two databases, which can be due to different reasons: 

1. Differences in the methodology used for the estimation of emissions. While countries apply tier 1 to tier 3 approaches, depending on the emission category, FAOSTAT estimations are based on a tier 1 approach, using always default emission factors. 
2. The use of different activity data, coming from different sources or suffering different processing after data collection.

Comparing the estimations of FAOSTAT with the UNFCCC inventory data, we find that the biggest absolute difference corresponds to: 

* `r checkcurdif("diff",1)`, followed by 
* `r checkcurdif("diff",2)` and 
* `r gsub("indirect", "Indirect", checkcurdif("diff",3))`. 

These three emission categories represent a significant  share of the total agricultural emissions in the NIR and FAO data bases, accounting for `r paste(range(curdiffs[1,c("relnir","relfao")]),collapse="-")`%, `r paste(range(curdiffs[2,c("relnir","relfao")]),collapse="-")`% and `r paste(range(curdiffs[3,c("relnir","relfao")]),collapse="-")`%, respectively. 

The largest three differences in relative terms are: 

* `r checkcurdif("reldiff",1)`, followed by 
* `r checkcurdif("reldiff",2)` and 
* `r checkcurdif("reldiff",3)`. 

The three source categories with the hightest absolute and relative differences are `r checkcurems(curdiffs[which(rank(rank(curdiffs$reldiff)+rank(curdiffs$diff))<3)[1],])`, `r checkcurems(curdiffs[which(rank(rank(curdiffs$reldiff)+rank(curdiffs$diff))<3)[2],])` and `r checkcurems(curdiffs[which(rank(rank(curdiffs$reldiff)+rank(curdiffs$diff))<3)[3],])`.

In the next sections, we will focus on the comparison of activity data, trying to find out if the differences found in both databases can explain the differences in emissions, analysing the trends of livestock population, fertiliser use and cultivated area along the inventory years (1990-`r faolast`).

We will employ two types of figures throughout this section. Figure of the type as in `r figs(paste0("comp1",cursec,"Dairy Cattle",curmea),display="cite")` show the trend of `r eukp` for both NIR and FAO, similar to the Figures used also in Section 5.2. The upper panel of the figure shows the trend in the data from NIR, and the lower panel shows the trend in the FAO data. The 10 most important countries are plotted explicitly with the pattern used also in the previous sections. The share of AD in the last reported year given next to the legend, and all other countries lumped together into the category 'Other'. This category contains only the 'other' countries with respect to the data base, thus the countries could be different for NIR and FAO.

Figures of the type as in `r figs(paste0("comp2",cursec,"Dairy Cattle",curmea),display="cite")` show three different perspectives on the comparison of the two data sets, using the average of data for the years 1990-`r faolast`: the chart on the left side shows the reported values in absolute units for both NIR and FAO; the chart in the middle shows the relative difference between both data sets, calculated as (FAO-NIR)/NIR. Thus, positive values indicate that the value from FAO are larger than the value from NIR, and negative values indicate that the values from NIR are larger. Large relative differences indicate a problem in data reporting by the countries, but is not necessarily an indication that this has a large impact for the overall total EU emissions. Therefore, the chart on the right side shows the importance of the difference observed in each countries, as compared to the `r eukp` total: (FAO~country~-NIR~country~)/NIR~EU~.


##### Animal populations 
Trends of population data in the two data sets and a comparison of average data in the period 1990 to `r faolast` are shown for dairy Cattle (`r figs(paste0("comp1",cursec,"Dairy Cattle",curmea),display="cite")` and `r figs(paste0("comp2",cursec,"Dairy Cattle",curmea),display="cite")`), non-dairy Cattle (`r figs(paste0("comp1",cursec,"Non-Dairy Cattle",curmea),display="cite")` and `r figs(paste0("comp2",cursec,"Non-Dairy Cattle",curmea),display="cite")`), sheep (`r figs(paste0("comp1",cursec,"Sheep",curmea),display="cite")` and `r figs(paste0("comp2",cursec,"Sheep",curmea),display="cite")`), swine (`r figs(paste0("comp1",cursec,"Swine",curmea),display="cite")` and `r figs(paste0("comp2",cursec,"Swine",curmea),display="cite")`) and poultry (`r figs(paste0("comp1",cursec,"Poultry",curmea),display="cite")` and `r figs(paste0("comp2",cursec,"Poultry",curmea),display="cite")`). The trends in the NIR data are discussed in detail in Section 5.2.

##### Nitrogen excretion

In addition to population data, nitrogen excretion data is another parameter with a high influence on emissions, notably on N2O emissions from manure in various emission categories. FAOSTAT calculates N excretion based on default typical animal mass and nitrogen excretion per animal mass unit, while UNFCCC provides national data, calculated with different methodologies. `r figs(paste0("comp1",cursec,"Dairy Cattle",curmea),display="cite")` through `r figs(paste0("comp2",cursec,"Poultry",curmea),display="cite")` compare UNFCCC vs. FAOSTAT data related to N excretion rate for the main livestock categories: dairy cattle, non-dairy cattle, sheep, swine and poultry.

```

Comparing N excretion from the different livestock categories between the two databases, we can see that, for most of them, FAOSTAT presents lower values, being these differences highest for (`r tolower(avallrel$category[maxcat])` (`r avallrel$mean[maxcat]`) the EU28+ISL average). Only for swine, approximately half of the countries are reporting higher values in their NIR than FAOSTAT. Individual differences by country for dairy cattle range from -50 to 5%, with a much more defined decrease time trend in the NIR data and differences between databases getting smaller along time for the EU28+ISL totals. For most the countries NIR values are larger, being Greece the only country with larger numbers in FAO (5%). Germany holds the highest difference share in absolute values (4% of total EU28+ISL), followed by France and the Netherlands (3.2 and 3.0%, respectively). Similarly, for N excretion from non-dairy cattle most countries present higher values in the NIR, where data is also (but more smoothly) decreasing in time and decreasing differences with FAO, which shows more stable values. Differences in individual countries range from -40 to 50% (Romania) for the average of the time series. Compared to EU28+ISL totals, France is, by far, responsible for the highest share in the total differences FAO-NIR (10% of the total), followed by United Kingdom (4%) and Ireland (3%). Not only differences for the EU totals but also for individual countries are highest for sheep, always bigger in the NIR database and ranging from nearly 0% in Romania to around 80% in many of the countries. Countries with the highest shares of Nex are also the responsible for the highest shares of total EU differences between databases: France, UK, Italy and Greece (15, 15, 14 and 12% of total EU28+ISL differences, respectively). N excretion from swine also shows a decreasing trend in the UNFCCC database, while FAO data is more stable in time. For the individual countries, differences in the average values along the total period range from -30% in the Czech Republic to 40% in Croatia and Luxemburg. Regarding their contribution to total EU28+ISL differences, Poland is in the first place with 2%, followed by Romania (1.8%). The contribution to the total differences is more equally distributed than in previous livestock categories. Regarding poultry, total N excretion for EU28+ISL is slightly increasing in time in FAO database and more irregularly fluctuating according to NIR data, but it is also lower in FAO, both for EU totals and for most of the countries. Individual country differences range from -40% in Romania and Slovakia to 85% in Luxemburg. Regarding country contribution to total EU differences, the biggest share corresponds to Romania with 7%, followed by Poland with 3.5%, and United Kingdom with 3%. Only for non-dairy cattle there is one country clearly dominating the differences in EU28+ISL N excretion, while the other livestock categories do not have one only main contributor.

##### Nitrogen input to agricultural soils

Nitrogen input to agricultural soils is an important factor both direct and indirect N2O emissions from managed soils. New nitrogen is added with synthetic fertilisers, while other nitrogen sources are recycling nitrogen that comes from livestock and manure management systems, food or other organic waste (compost) or from sewage systems. In the following we compare nitrogen input agricultural soils as mineral fertilisers (`r figs(paste0("comp1",cursec,"min",curmea),display="cite")` and `r figs(paste0("comp2",cursec,"min",curmea),display="cite")`), applied organic fertilisers (`r figs(paste0("comp1",cursec,"man",curmea),display="cite")` and `r figs(paste0("comp2",cursec,"man",curmea),display="cite")`), and crop residues (`r figs(paste0("comp1",cursec,"cres",curmea),display="cite")` and `r figs(paste0("comp2",cursec,"cres",curmea),display="cite")`).

From the three nitrogen sources analysed above, all three present higher total values in the NIR data, but differences are highest in synthetic fertilisers applied. Time trends are quite smooth in the first two cases, with some sudden steps in crop residues applied to soils, which are probably due to climatic reasons and captured by both databases.

##### Cultivation of histosols

Focusing on the area of cultivated organic soils, we can see in `r figs(paste0("comp1",cursec,"Histosols",curmea),display="cite")` and `r figs(paste0("comp2",cursec,"Histosols",curmea),display="cite")` that total EU-28 area provided by FAOSTAT is higher than the area reported by countries to UNFCCC, constant in both databases for nearly the whole time series.

```

An in-depth comparison of the area of cultivated organic soils as reported by the FAO, in the NIRs, and with calculations done at the JRC has been performed by JRC in October 2013.

The FAO (FAO, 2103) provides area of cultivated organic soils on country level. The analysis is based on the Harmonized World Soil Database - HWSD - (FAO/IIASA/ISRIC/ISSCAS/JRC, 2009) and the Global Land Cover data set for the year 2000 (GLC2000). 

At JRC the area of cultivated organic soils for the single countries in EU27 has been derived from overlaying the HWSD with the CORINE Land Use/Cover data set - CLC2006 (EEA, 2011) for the year 2006 (for some countries 2000). Both data sets have been resampled to a 1km by 1km raster cell size.

Definition of organic soils as given in IPCC (2006) based on FAO (1998): 
Soils are organic if they satisfy the requirements 1 and 2, or 1 and 3 below (FAO, 1998): 

#. Thickness of 10 cm or more. A horizon less than 20 cm thick must have 12 percent or more organic carbon when mixed to a depth of 20 cm; 
#.	If the soil is never saturated with water for more than a few days, and contains more than 20 percent (by weight) organic carbon (about 35 percent organic matter); 
#.	If the soil is subject to water saturation episodes and has either: (i) at least 12 percent (by weight) organic carbon (about 20 percent organic matter) if it has no clay; or (ii) at least 18 percent (by weight) organic carbon (about 30 percent organic matter) if it has 60 percent or more clay; or (iii) an intermediate, proportional amount of organic carbon for intermediate amounts of clay (FAO, 1998).

FAO gave larger area of organic soils cultivated compared to JRC results for all countries except Germany `r figs("fighist",display="cite")`. This was mainly due to different source data sets for delineation of cropland area and the assumptions regarding the land use classification.

In the JRC approach Soil Typological Units (STU) of the HWSD are defined as 'organic soils' 

(#) if the topsoil organic carbon content is > 18% or 
(#) if the topsoil organic carbon content is higher than the topsoil clay content * 0.1 + 12. All STUs in the EU27 of the HWSD which have been classified as 'organic soils' showed an organic carbon content of >30%, thus de facto only criterion (1) was applied.

To delineate 'cropland area' in the land use/cover map, FAO considers pure cropland classes as well as mixed cropland/other land use classes. For the latter, assumptions were made on the share of cropland within these mixed classes. However,  the JRC approach takes assumes that in case of mixed land use classes the probability of the different land uses happening on organic soils are not the same, in contract to the approach of the FAO, which distribute land cover proportionally.  As some crops do not grow well on organic soils it might occur that the land uses are not distributed equally on the mineral and organic soil but that 100% of the forest is grown an organic soil and the crops are cultivated only on mineral soils.

In the JRC analysis mixed land use classes are not taken into account as the shares of cropland within these classes are given as ranges in the legend of CORINE. The cropland/other land use shares in the mixed land use classes might also vary between regions. Thus, by excluding mixed land use classes, the estimate of cropland area on organic soils can be considered as conservative compared to the FAO approach.

##### Conclusion

**xxxTODOxxx Here some summary that combines the findings from the comparison of the emissions in the intro with the findings of the AD comparison. E.g. which AD might be most culprit for differences? we can focus on organic soils, 3b2 and indirect N2O emissions, and rice cultivation. In the discussion we could use info from the 'methodologies', e.g. for indirect emissions if most countries use country-specific fractions, than this explains it??? for 3b2 which animal type??**
