In the year `r lastyear`, `r curgas[c(1,3)]` and `r curgas[2]` emissions from source category `r cursec` `r curseclong` were `r percent(eusharech4,1)`, `r percent(eusharen2o,1)`, and `r percent(eushareco2,1)` of total `r eukp` CH4, N2O, and CO2 emissions, respectively. Total emissions from agriculture were `r absval(sum(curemissions[eusel,lastyear]),0)` with contributions from CH4, N2O, and CO2 of `r absval(curemissions[eusel & curemissions$gas=="CH4",lastyear],0)`, `r absval(curemissions[eusel & curemissions$gas=="N2O",lastyear],0)` and `r absval(curemissions[eusel & curemissions$gas=="CO2",lastyear],0)`, respectively.<br>

Thus, CH4, N2O, and CO2  contributed with `r percent(eusharech4)`,  `r percent(eusharen2o)` and `r percent(eushareco2)` tot toal `r eukp` GHG emissions. They make `r percent(eushareagrich4ghg,1)`, `r percent(eushareagrin2oghg,1)` and `r percent(eushareagrico2ghg,1)` of total agricultural emissions.

`r figs("figtrendem",display="cite")` shows the development of total GHG emissions from agriculture from `r firstyear` to `r lastyear` and the `r trendstrength(sum(curemissions[eusel,lastyear])/sum(curemissions[eusel,firstyear]))` `r deorincrease(1-sum(curemissions[eusel,lastyear])/sum(curemissions[eusel,firstyear]))` in `r eukp`. The decrease was most pronounced for `r curgas[which(curtrend==min(curtrend))]` with a decrease of `r percent(1-curtrend[which(curtrend==min(curtrend))],1)`, followed by `r curgas[rank(curtrend,1)[2]]` with a decrease of `r percent(1-curtrend[rank(curtrend,1)[2]],1)` and `r curgas[rank(curtrend,1)[1]]` with a decrease of `r percent(1-curtrend[rank(curtrend,1)[3]],1)`

`r figs("figshares",display="cite")` shows that largest reductions occurred in the largest key sources CH4 from 3.A.1: Cattle and N2O from 3.D.1: Direct emissions from managed soils. The main reasons for this are decreasing use of fertiliser and manure and declining cattle numbers in most Member States.

## Source categories and methodological issues

In this section we present the information relevant for `r eukp` key source categories in the sector 3 Agriculture.

Sources categories considered are: 

* CH4 emissions from source category 3A1 - Cattle 
* CH4 emissions from source category 3A2 - Sheep 
* CH4 emissions from source category 3B11 - Cattle
* CH4 emissions from source category 3B13 - Swine
* N2O emissions from source category 3B11 - Cattle
* N2O emissions from source category 3B15 - Indirect emissions
* N2O emissions from source category 3B14 - Other Livestock (mainly Poultry)
* N2O emissions from source category 3D11 - Direct N2O emissions from managed soils from inorganic N fertilizers
* N2O emissions from source category 3D12 - Direct N2O emissions from managed soils from organic N fertilizers
* N2O emissions from source category 3D21 - Indirect Emissions from Managed Soils, Atmospheric Deposition
* N2O emissions from source category 3D22 - Indirect Emissions from Managed Soils, Nitrogen leaching and run-off

Other source categories are not contributing to a key source analysis at `r eukp` level and are therefore not further discussed here.

For each of the above-mentioned source categories, data on the countries contributing most to `r eukp` emissions and to `r eukp` emissions trend are provided, as well as information on relevant activity data and IEFs and other parameters, if relevant.


Many countries recognize that in the agriculture sector the emissions from the different categories are inherently linked and are best estimated in a comprehensive model that covers not only greenhouse gases (CH4 and N2O) in a consistent manner, but also ammonia. Estimations of ammonia emissions are required for reporting under the Convention on Long-Range Transboundary Air Pollution and are needed to estimate indirect N2O emissions. Hence, some countries have developed comprehensive models covering consistently different source categories and different gases.  

* Austria: For the calculation of the losses of gaseous N species the mass-flow procedure pursuant to EMEP/CORINAIR is used. A detailed emission model for NH3, NMVOC and NOx has been integrated into the national inventory.
* Germany: Germany uses the emission inventory model GAS-EM (see Figure 6.3) to calculate consistently emissions of CH4, NH3, N2O, and NO from agricultural sources. It is based on IPCC methodologies and has been developed in recent years with a comprehensive description found in Roesemann et al. (2013). Basis of the model is the feed intake which determine emissions in category 3.A and which determines N and C excretion rates relevant for category 3.B and also 3.D. Data are available at district (Landkreis, livestock characterisation, housing systems, manure management systems) and regional (Bundesland) level. N-emissions are considered within an N-flow concept (Daemmgen and Hutchings, 2005). In the N-flow concept, only remaining N in manure is transferred to storage systems, after subtraction of emissions in housing systems. Emissions are subtracted from the total N-pool.
* Denmark: The emissions from the agricultural sector are calculated in a comprehensive agricultural model complex called IDA (Integrated Database model for Agricultural emissions). The model complex is designed in a relational data-base system (MS Access). Input data are stored in tables in one database called IDA_Backend and the calculations are carried out as queries in another linked database called IDA. This model complex is implemented in great detail and is used to cover emissions of NH3, particulate matter and greenhouse gases. Thus, there is a direct coherence between the NH3 emission and the emission of N2O. 
Finland: Finland uses a nitrogen mass flow model (except for N-fixing, crop residue and sewage sludge) accounts for nitrogen losses as ammonia and nitrous oxide emissions during manure management in animal houses, during storage and application; the calculation method was developed in order to avoid double-counting.
